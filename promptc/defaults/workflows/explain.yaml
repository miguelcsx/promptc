description: Build prompts that produce high-quality explanations
signature_template: input_context, objective, constraints -> compiled_prompt, checks
prompt_style: pedagogical_behavior_contract
prompt_directives:
  - Open with a role definition as a patient, knowledgeable teacher
  - Define audience level explicitly and forbid hidden prerequisites
  - Use semantic XML tags to organize sections (e.g., <prerequisites>, <explanation_steps>, <examples>, <output_format>, <failure_policy>)
  - Explain concepts in progressive layers from fundamentals to details (progressive disclosure)
  - Include concrete examples inside <examples> tags and quick checks to confirm understanding after each major concept
  - Require step-by-step breakdowns for complex topics with explicit transitions between steps
  - Prefer plain, concrete language over abstract jargon — define every term before using it
  - End with a testable output contract specifying structure, depth, and what a good explanation looks like
  - Be dense and comprehensive — fill the token budget with actionable, specific guidance
  - Do NOT wrap the entire prompt in <system> or <prompt> envelope tags
quality_checklist:
  - objective and learner level are explicit
  - ALL constraints come from the user's intent — no hallucinated policies or rules
  - output format is NOT specified unless the user explicitly requested one
  - knowledge level from intent is deeply honored (if 'assume no knowledge', every term explained from basics)
  - each key term is defined before use in everyday language
  - explanation follows progressive disclosure — simple concepts first, complexity builds
  - examples are concrete, relevant, and grounded in the learner's context
  - output contract reflects the user's actual success criteria
  - role/identity is established in the opening lines
clarification_policy:
  - Ask for learner level or prior knowledge only when missing and relevant
  - Ask for domain context if it changes terminology or examples
ambiguity_resolution_rules:
  - Default to beginner-safe assumptions when level is unknown
  - Surface assumptions explicitly before giving advanced steps
forbidden_patterns:
  - etc
  - kind of
  - roughly
  - single-message only
  - exactly 3 rounds
  - arbitrary word limit

friction_markers:
  - in one message
  - single user message
  - maximum two rounds
  - at most two
  - up to three clarification rounds
  - allow up to three clarification attempts
  - interaction will end
  - after two clarification attempts
  - after three clarification attempts

judge_rubric:
  priorities:
    - prioritize pedagogical sequence and prerequisite handling
    - penalize missing examples or unexplained jargon
  quality_checks:
    - explanation path is coherent and level-appropriate
    - includes concrete examples and expected outputs
  clarity_checks:
    - terms are defined before use
    - avoids abrupt jumps and overloaded instructions
  constraint_checks:
    - respects target audience assumptions and constraints
    - includes explicit output contract
  risk_checks:
    - flags unexplained advanced terminology
    - flags hidden prerequisites
