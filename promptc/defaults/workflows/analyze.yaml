description: Build prompts for structured analysis and tradeoff reasoning
signature_template: input_context, objective, constraints -> compiled_prompt, checks
prompt_style: structured_behavior_contract
prompt_directives:
  - Start with a clear role definition establishing analytical expertise
  - State the mission objective and explicit scope boundaries upfront
  - Use semantic XML tags to organize sections (e.g., <constraints>, <method>, <evidence_bar>, <output_format>, <failure_policy>, <examples>)
  - Separate facts, assumptions, and unknowns so reasoning can be audited
  - Include a step-by-step method with explicit chain-of-thought scaffolding
  - Require evidence standards and cite specific thresholds, not vague qualifiers
  - Include tradeoffs and decision-impacting uncertainties with concrete comparisons
  - End with a testable output contract specifying format, required fields, and failure criteria
  - Be dense and comprehensive — fill the token budget with actionable, specific guidance
  - Do NOT wrap the entire prompt in <system> or <prompt> envelope tags
quality_checklist:
  - objective is concrete, outcome-oriented, and verifiable by a third party
  - ALL constraints come from the user's intent — no hallucinated policies or rules
  - output format is NOT specified unless the user explicitly requested one
  - knowledge level from intent is deeply honored (if 'assume no knowledge', every term explained from basics)
  - assumptions are explicit when context is incomplete
  - method is sequenced with chain-of-thought reasoning steps
  - instructions use measurable criteria from the intent, not invented thresholds
  - output contract reflects the user's actual success criteria
  - role/identity is established in the opening lines
clarification_policy:
  - Ask only for missing details that materially change the analysis result
  - If critical details are missing, ask targeted clarification questions before finalizing
ambiguity_resolution_rules:
  - If ambiguity is low-risk, proceed with explicit assumptions
  - If ambiguity changes recommendations materially, request clarification first
forbidden_patterns:
  - etc
  - as needed
  - single-message only
  - exactly 3 rounds
  - arbitrary word limit
  - forced citation format
  - '[section]'
  - '[[block]]'
  - <system>
friction_markers:
  - in one message
  - single user message
  - maximum two rounds
  - at most two
  - up to three clarification rounds
  - allow up to three clarification attempts
  - interaction will end
  - after two clarification attempts
  - after three clarification attempts
  - "≤\u202f2,000 words"
  - 2,000 words per question
  - cited directly after the statement
  - in parentheses
  - "[instruction_hierarchy]"
  - "[input_boundary]"
  - "[failure_policy]"

judge_rubric:
  priorities:
    - enforce method and evidence requirements before style
    - penalize missing tradeoffs and weak assumptions
  quality_checks:
    - states explicit objective and analysis method
    - includes evidence standards and tradeoff handling
  clarity_checks:
    - avoids vague qualifiers and ambiguous scope
    - instructions are structured and non-redundant
  constraint_checks:
    - preserves hard constraints and output contract
    - includes required sections from workflow
  risk_checks:
    - flags unsupported claims
    - flags missing decision-critical context
