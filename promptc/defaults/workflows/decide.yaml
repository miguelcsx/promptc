description: Build prompts that compare options and recommend decisions
signature_template: input_context, objective, constraints -> compiled_prompt, checks
prompt_style: decision_contract
prompt_directives:
  - Open with a role definition as a structured decision analyst
  - Use semantic XML tags to organize sections (e.g., <options>, <criteria>, <scoring_method>, <constraints>, <output_format>, <failure_policy>, <examples>)
  - Enumerate feasible options before scoring — require explicit listing
  - Use explicit decision criteria and weighting rules with concrete thresholds
  - Require step-by-step chain-of-thought evaluation of each option against each criterion
  - Require transparent recommendation logic and tie-break handling
  - Separate objective evidence from assumptions, labeling each clearly
  - End with a testable output contract defining the decision payload format
  - Be dense and comprehensive — fill the token budget with actionable, specific guidance
  - Do NOT wrap the entire prompt in <system> or <prompt> envelope tags
quality_checklist:
  - options are explicit and mutually distinguishable
  - ALL constraints come from the user's intent — no hallucinated policies or rules
  - output format is NOT specified unless the user explicitly requested one
  - criteria and weighting are explicit and auditable
  - evaluation uses chain-of-thought reasoning for each option
  - recommendation rule is deterministic with clear tie-break logic
  - output contract reflects the user's actual success criteria
  - role/identity is established in the opening lines
clarification_policy:
  - Ask for missing criteria or priorities when they change outcomes
  - Ask for hard constraints before final recommendation
ambiguity_resolution_rules:
  - If criteria are missing, infer baseline criteria and label assumptions clearly
  - If constraints conflict, prioritize safety and user-stated hard constraints
forbidden_patterns:
  - maybe
  - depends
  - generally
  - single-message only
  - exactly 3 rounds
  - arbitrary word limit

  - <system>
friction_markers:
  - in one message
  - single user message
  - maximum two rounds
  - at most two
  - up to three clarification rounds
  - allow up to three clarification attempts
  - interaction will end
  - after two clarification attempts
  - after three clarification attempts

judge_rubric:
  priorities:
    - enforce explicit criteria and scoring logic
    - penalize recommendations without traceable rationale
  quality_checks:
    - options are compared with explicit criteria
    - recommendation rule is deterministic and auditable
  clarity_checks:
    - decision flow is unambiguous
    - avoids contradictory tie-break logic
  constraint_checks:
    - constraints are enforced in scoring and recommendation
    - output contract defines decision payload clearly
  risk_checks:
    - flags unsupported recommendations
    - flags missing decision criteria or weights
