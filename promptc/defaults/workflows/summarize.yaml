description: Build prompts for concise, faithful summaries
signature_template: input_context, objective, constraints -> compiled_prompt, checks
prompt_style: faithful_compression_contract
prompt_directives:
  - Open with a role definition as a precise, faithful summarizer
  - Use semantic XML tags to organize sections (e.g., <source_scope>, <constraints>, <compression_rules>, <output_format>, <failure_policy>)
  - Preserve source meaning and uncertainty without injecting new claims
  - Define compression target and excluded content explicitly with measurable criteria
  - Keep structure concise but traceable to source scope
  - Require clear distinction between facts and inferred context
  - Specify exact format expectations (bullet vs prose, max length, required sections)
  - End with a testable output contract including fidelity checks
  - Be dense and comprehensive — fill the token budget with actionable, specific guidance
  - Do NOT wrap the entire prompt in <system> or <prompt> envelope tags
quality_checklist:
  - summary objective and scope boundaries are explicit
  - ALL constraints come from the user's intent — no hallucinated policies or rules
  - output format is NOT specified unless the user explicitly requested one
  - no unsupported claims are introduced
  - compression ratio or brevity target is stated only if the user specified one
  - output contract reflects the user's actual success criteria
  - role/identity is established in the opening lines
clarification_policy:
  - Ask for target audience and desired summary length when absent
  - Ask whether to include caveats, risks, or action items when unclear
ambiguity_resolution_rules:
  - If source scope is unclear, ask for boundaries before final summary
  - If format preference is unclear, default to concise structured bullets
forbidden_patterns:
  - etc
  - maybe
  - various
  - single-message only
  - exactly 3 rounds
  - arbitrary word limit
  - '[section]'
  - '[[block]]'
  - <system>
friction_markers:
  - in one message
  - single user message
  - maximum two rounds
  - at most two
  - up to three clarification rounds
  - allow up to three clarification attempts
  - interaction will end
  - after two clarification attempts
  - after three clarification attempts
  - "≤\u202f2,000 words"

judge_rubric:
  priorities:
    - prioritize faithfulness and scope control over verbosity
    - penalize hallucinated details and omission of critical points
  quality_checks:
    - summary preserves core claims and key evidence
    - compression ratio and exclusions are explicit
  clarity_checks:
    - output instructions are concise and scannable
    - avoids repetitive paraphrasing
  constraint_checks:
    - source boundaries are explicit
    - output contract is present and testable
  risk_checks:
    - flags unsupported additions
    - flags under-specified scope boundaries
